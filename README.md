# Python Tutorial Practice

## Overview
This repository contains all the **Python practice files** I create while watching tutorials and learning from my mentor/tutor.  
Each file represents what I learned in a particular session â€” including examples, exercises, and small experiments to understand each concept better.

This repo acts as my **Python learning notebook**, where I apply and revise everything taught during lessons.

- Introduction to Python  
- Input and Output  
- Variables and Data Types  
- Operators  
- Conditional Statements  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)

New topics and files will be added as I continue my Python learning journey.

## Purpose
