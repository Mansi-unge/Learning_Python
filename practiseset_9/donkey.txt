Once upon a time, there was a donkey named Bruno who lived in a small village. The donkey was kind but very lazy. Every morning, the farmer called out, “Come on, donkey, it’s time to work!” But the donkey would yawn and move slowly toward the fields. One day, the donkey met another donkey who loved helping people. Seeing this, Bruno decided to change. From that day on, the donkey worked hard, carried loads happily, and became everyone’s favorite donkey in the village.
